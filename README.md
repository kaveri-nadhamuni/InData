## Welcome to Indata
I'm Kaveri Nadhamuni, founder of Indata. Indata is a collection of data analytics projects on the Indian education system I started in 9th grade. I've always been interested in the intersection of development issues and computer science. I'm trying to understand developmental issues in India using data analytics and visualisations.

1. Do boys do better than girls?
2. Does English help learn Science and Math better? 
3. Do Govt. shcools do better than private?
