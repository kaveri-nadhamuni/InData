## Welcome to Indata
Indata is a collection of short data analytics studies on the Indian education system. By analysing massive government education datasets, I uncovered interesting findings about the academic performance, school structure, and social determinants of hundreds of thousands of students across India. I also discovered some statistics and trends related to the operation of the schooling system. I used Python and its data anlytics and visualizations libraries to process and present the data, and wrote up explanations and further research of my findings.
